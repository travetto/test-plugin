Test-Plugin
===

The [`plugin`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcsine.travetto-test-plugin) directly integrates with the test module to provide real-time feedback on unit tests within `vscode`.  This is the preferred method of execution during development.

Any test can be debugged on demand by running `command-shift-t` on OSX or `ctrl-shift-t` on win/linux. 

## Requirements

Tests will run on initial load of any file in the `test/*` directory that contains a `@Test` decorator.
